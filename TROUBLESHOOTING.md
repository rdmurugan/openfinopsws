# Website Not Opening - Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue
openfinops.org is not opening in your browser

## Verification from Server Side ✅

The website IS working and accessible:

```bash
✅ https://openfinops.org/ - HTTP/2 200
✅ https://openfinops.org/features.html - Loading correctly
✅ https://openfinops.org/css/style.css - Loading correctly
✅ SSL Certificate: Approved and active
✅ DNS: Correctly configured
```

## Most Likely Causes

### 1. DNS Cache on Your Computer (Most Common)

Your computer may still be using the old DNS records.

**Solution - Clear DNS Cache:**

**macOS:**
```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
echo "DNS cache cleared"
```

**Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig /flushdns
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
# OR
sudo /etc/init.d/nscd restart
```

### 2. Browser Cache Issue

Your browser may have cached the old SSL error page.

**Solution - Hard Refresh:**

- **Chrome/Edge:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- **Firefox:** `Ctrl+F5` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- **Safari:** `Cmd+Option+R`

**OR Clear Browser Cache:**
1. Open browser settings
2. Clear browsing data / Clear cache
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Clear data
5. Close and reopen browser

### 3. Still Seeing SSL Certificate Error

If you still see the *.github.io certificate error:

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache (see above)
2. Try in Incognito/Private mode
3. Wait 5-10 more minutes for SSL certificate to fully activate

### 4. DNS Not Propagated in Your Region

DNS can take up to 48 hours to propagate worldwide (usually 15-60 minutes).

**Check DNS from your computer:**

```bash
# Check what DNS your computer sees
nslookup openfinops.org

# Should show:
# 185.199.108.153
# 185.199.109.153
# 185.199.110.153
# 185.199.111.153
```

**If you see different IPs (198.185.159.x), DNS hasn't propagated yet.**

**Temporary Solution - Use Different DNS:**

Change your DNS to Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS:

**Google DNS:**
- Primary: 8.8.8.8
- Secondary: 8.8.4.4

**Cloudflare DNS:**
- Primary: 1.1.1.1
- Secondary: 1.0.0.1

**How to change DNS:**
- macOS: System Preferences → Network → Advanced → DNS
- Windows: Network Settings → Change Adapter Options → IPv4 Properties → DNS
- Linux: Edit /etc/resolv.conf

## Quick Tests

### Test 1: Check DNS from your computer
```bash
ping openfinops.org
```
Should resolve to one of: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, or 185.199.111.153

### Test 2: Try HTTPS directly
```bash
curl -I https://openfinops.org
```
Should return HTTP/2 200

### Test 3: Access via direct GitHub Pages URL (bypass DNS)
Try: https://rdmurugan.github.io/openfinopsws/

If this works but openfinops.org doesn't, it's a DNS issue on your end.

### Test 4: Try different browsers
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

If it works in one browser but not another, it's a browser cache issue.

### Test 5: Try Incognito/Private Mode
This bypasses browser cache. If it works here, clear your browser cache.

## Alternative Access Methods

While waiting for DNS/cache to clear:

1. **Direct GitHub Pages URL:**
   https://rdmurugan.github.io/openfinopsws/

2. **Use different network:**
   - Mobile hotspot
   - Different WiFi network
   - VPN

## Expected Timeline

| Action | Time |
|--------|------|
| Clear DNS cache | Immediate |
| Clear browser cache | Immediate |
| DNS propagation | 15-60 minutes (up to 48 hours) |
| SSL certificate activation | Already active |

## Verification

Once working, you should see:
- ✅ Green padlock in browser (HTTPS)
- ✅ Certificate issued to: openfinops.org
- ✅ Certificate issued by: Let's Encrypt
- ✅ Website loads with proper styling

## Still Not Working?

If none of the above solutions work:

1. **Check from another device/network:**
   - Try from your phone (using mobile data, not WiFi)
   - Try from another computer

2. **Check online tools:**
   - https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/openfinops.org
   - https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/openfinops.org.html

3. **Provide error details:**
   - What error do you see?
   - Screenshot of the error
   - Browser and version
   - Operating system
   - Output of: `nslookup openfinops.org`

## Current Status (Verified Working)

```
Website URL: https://openfinops.org
Status: ✅ ONLINE
SSL Certificate: ✅ ACTIVE (Let's Encrypt)
DNS Configuration: ✅ CORRECT
HTTP Response: ✅ 200 OK

Test from server:
$ curl -I https://openfinops.org
HTTP/2 200 ✅
server: GitHub.com ✅
```

**The website IS working. The issue is client-side (your computer/browser/network).**

Most likely fix: **Clear your DNS cache and browser cache, then hard refresh.**
